                    <strong>Q. Who we are?</strong>
                    <p>Launched in January 2003, SUB Associates provides Global Management, Corporate Training, 
                        and Executive Staffing services to the Nanotechnology, Information Technology,
                         Medical Sciences, Clean Technology, and Telecommunication industry. SUB Associates 
                         offers well-focused services to our valuable clients, regardless of the location or 
                         size of the company.</p>

                    <strong>Q. How do we begin working with Sub Associates?</strong>
                    <p>Once a need for our services is identified, we submit a proposal, 
                        outlining a clear set of deliverables and an estimated cost for our services. 
                        Upon mutual agreement, we will begin the project and review progress on a regular basis. 
                        Once the project has been completed, a closure meeting is set up to make sure that all 
                        expectations were met and that there are no loose ends. On-going "service" support can be 
                        provided to our clients as needed.</p>

                    <strong>Q. How much do your services cost?</strong>
                    <p>Generally, it depends on the project. 
                        SUB Associates will give you an estimate of project cost based upon a mutually determined o
                        utline of deliverables. We strive to produce exceptional value for the client, and our fees
                         are small in comparison to this value.</p>

                    <strong>Q. Why SUB Associates instead of the big name consulting companies?</strong>
                    <p>SUB Associates is industry focused. This creates a richer set of solutions for our 
                        clients in this area. We have years of experience in offering services at some of th
                        e most respective companies in the high technology-semiconductor industry and are focused
                         on results that matter to your business success. We are not consultants in the traditional
                         sense where the deliverable is a long list of elaborate recommendations that may or may not get implemented.

                    <strong>Q. Why SUB Associates instead of an internal resource? </strong>
                    <p>There are several reasons for utilizing our services:

                    </p>

                        <p><strong>Expertise: </strong>Our experience in providing solutions to a variety of 
                            OEMs, EMS companies, and component suppliers leads us to devise a solution that leverages
                             the “best practices” across the industry.</p>

                        <p><strong>Focus: </strong>Sub Associates can provide dedicated resources to help drive a project to completion in the agreed upon timeframe.</p>
                        <p><strong>Perspective: </strong>We provide you with an objective assessment of the problem and propose solutions. Our interest is to give the client a solution that will meet the outlined objectives rather than maintaining the status quo.</p>
                        <p><strong>Limited Obligation: </strong>Many times, companies need experienced resources to help with the peaks in workload that comes with managing a business change. Too often, they under-staff critical projects because they cannot afford to take talented individuals out of their current role within the company. SUB Associates have passion to commit, dedicate and deliver on time. </p>
